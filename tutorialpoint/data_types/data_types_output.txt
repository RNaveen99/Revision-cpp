        _**Nevertheless**, This shows that using these are risky,
         as they are version dependent even on the same comiler_

_In the light of above output and [Ideone output](https://ideone.com/2hFsNo), we can fairly conclude that
it is safe to use ideone and trust its result in such cases, as most online compiler follow same norms._
